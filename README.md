# author-geo

**An author website that machines can read.** A clone-and-edit starter for a
book-focused author site whose books, series, themes, and identity are emitted as
first-class, validated **JSON-LD / schema.org** structured data — so search engines
and LLMs can understand who you are and what you've written. ("GEO" =
Generative Engine Optimization.)

You bring the content (Markdown files describing your books and yourself); the
engine turns it into a fast static site with correct, cross-linked structured data
baked into every page.

- **Tier 1 (this repo):** a pure static site, deployed to **Cloudflare Pages**.
- **Tier 2 (deferred, seam in place):** a live newsletter signup endpoint. The
  form ships now and goes live when Tier 2 lands — see [Tier 2](#tier-2--whats-deferred).

> **Editing this site with an AI agent?** Point it at **[`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md)** —
> a self-contained authoring procedure (the content contract, the per-type recipes,
> and the validation gate to run before committing). This README is the *reference*;
> `SKILL.md` is the *loop*.

## Quickstart

```sh
npm install
npm run dev      # local dev server at http://localhost:4321
npm run build    # production build -> dist/
npm run preview  # serve the built dist/ locally
```

Requires **Node >= 22.12**.

Out of the box the site builds with **example content** (a fictional author,
three sample books, one series, one theme). Everything under `src/content/` is
placeholder — delete it and drop in your own. See [Adding your content](#adding-your-content).

---

## How it's organized (engine vs. content)

The repo is split into two zones on purpose:

| Zone | Path | Who owns it |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Engine** | `src/` (layouts, components, `lib/`, page templates, schemas) | The template. Pull upstream to get fixes/features. |
| **Content** | `src/content/` + `src/config.ts` | **You.** Your books, series, and identity. Stays conflict-free on upstream pulls. |

The one rule: **edit your content and `src/config.ts`; leave the rest to the engine.**
If you find yourself changing engine code to make content work, that's usually a
sign a field belongs in the schema instead — see [For developers](#for-developers--ai-editors).

---

## Adding your content

All content lives in `src/content/`, one folder per collection. Each file is
Markdown with a YAML frontmatter block (the structured part) and optional body
text below. **The frontmatter is validated by a Zod schema** (`src/content.config.ts`)
— an invalid or missing field **fails the build with a clear error**, by design.
That schema is the single source of truth; the tables below mirror it, but if the
two ever disagree, **the schema wins**.

> **Note for AI editors:** do not guess field names. Read `src/content.config.ts`,
> match it exactly, and then run the [validation gate](#validating-your-structured-data).
> A build can pass while emitting subtly wrong structured data (e.g. a canonical
> URL on the wrong node) — the gate, not the build, is what proves correctness.

### Author — `src/content/author/<slug>.md`

Your identity. This is where the **canonical `Person` node** lives (at
`{siteUrl}/about#<slug>`); every book references it by `@id`, never re-defining it.
Co-authors each get their own file here.

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `slug` | ✅ | Drives the canonical `@id` (`{siteUrl}/about#<slug>`). Stable — don't change it casually. |
| `name` | ✅ | Display / legal author name. |
| `alternateName` | | Array of pen names / initials, e.g. `["S. Voss"]`. |
| `bio` | ✅ | Prose bio; also feeds the About page and the (truncated) homepage blurb. |
| `photo` | | Path to an image, e.g. `./sera.jpg`. Optional. |
| `url` | ✅ | Kept for backward compatibility, but **not currently used anywhere in generated output** (fixed 2026-07-23): the schema.org `Person.url` is now always the author's own canonical `/about` page, derived by the engine, not read from this field. Nothing else on the site renders it either. Safe to leave as-is or ignore. |
| `sameAs` | | Array of URLs that disambiguate you: Wikipedia/Wikidata, Goodreads author page, socials. Strongly recommended for GEO. |
| `email` | | Optional contact email. |

### Book — `src/content/books/<slug>.md` (or `<slug>/index.md` with a local cover)

```yaml
---
title: "The Long Dark Between"
subtitle: "A Novel of the Drift"        # optional
slug: "the-long-dark-between"
description: "When the last generation ship loses its ansible link..."  # the blurb — required

authors:                                 # ARRAY, min 1 — co-author-safe (DD-001)
  - "malorie"                            #   each entry is an author SLUG (references src/content/author/)
series: "the-cinder-cycle"               # optional — a series slug
seriesPosition: 2                        # optional — MUST be a whole number (0 for a prequel that reads before book 1)
datePublished: "2024-03-05"
language: "en"                           # default: en
genres: ["science fiction", "hard sci-fi"]
editions:                                # ARRAY, min 1 — at least one buy link
  - format: "ebook"                      #   ebook | paperback | hardcover | audiobook
    retailer: "Amazon"
    url: "https://.../buy/ebook"         #   the BUY LINK lives on the edition (-> schema Offer.url), NOT on the book (DD-005)
    price: "4.99"                        #   REQUIRED — plain decimal string, no currency symbols/commas
    currency: "USD"                      #   default USD — must be a 3-letter ISO 4217 code
    isbn: "978..."                       #   optional
    asin: "B0..."                        #   optional
comps:                                   # optional — "comparable titles", rendered inline on the book page
  - name: "The Expanse"
    hook: "found-family crew under existential ship-systems pressure"  # REQUIRED, min 20 chars — never a bare name
    sameAs: ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_novel_series"] # optional — disambiguates the real work
---
Optional long-form body copy about the book goes here.
```

Two rules the schema enforces that matter for structured data:
- **`authors` is always an array** (min 1). A solo book is `["you"]`; a two-hander
  is `["you", "coauthor"]`. This is DD-001 — the model is co-author-safe everywhere.
- **`editions` is always an array** (min 1), and each edition's `url` is its
  **buy link**. This becomes a schema.org `Offer.url`, *not* the Book's `url`.
  The Book's own canonical `url` is its page on your site (the engine sets it). This
  is DD-005 — a retailer link in `Book.url` would falsely claim the retailer as the
  canonical home of the work.
- **`seriesPosition` must be a whole number.** It feeds `ListItem.position` in the
  series' reading-order JSON-LD, which schema.org (and any consumer sorting by it)
  expects to be an integer — a fractional placeholder like `0.5` for "this is a
  prequel" fails the build now rather than silently shipping an unusable ordering
  value. If a book reads before the series' book 1, give it `seriesPosition: 0`
  instead of inventing a fractional slot.

### Series — `src/content/series/<slug>.md`

A named sequence of books. Membership is **derived from the books** (any book with
`series: "<this-slug>"`), so you don't list books here — you tag them on the book.

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `name` | ✅ | Display name, e.g. "The Cinder Cycle". |
| `slug` | ✅ | Used in the URL (`/series/<slug>`) and referenced by books. |
| `description` | ✅ | |
| `authors` | ✅ | Array of author slugs (min 1). |
| `cover` | | Optional image. |
| `comps` | | Same shape as book comps. |

### Theme (hub) — `src/content/hubs/<slug>.md`

A curated collection of books "about" a topic (a `CollectionPage` in schema.org).
Route is `/themes/<slug>` (the collection folder is named `hubs`; the URL says
`themes`).

```yaml
---
name: "Human-AI Partnership"
slug: "human-ai-partnership"
description: "Books exploring what it means when minds depend on each other..."
about:                                   # ARRAY, min 1 — the DefinedTerm(s) this hub is about
  - term: "Artificial intelligence in fiction"
    sameAs: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_fiction"  # optional but recommended
  - term: "Human–AI collaboration"
books:                                   # ARRAY, min 1 — ORDERED list of book slugs (becomes an ItemList)
  - "the-cinder-reach"
  - "the-long-dark-between"
---
```

Unlike a series (membership derived from books), a hub's `books` list is **explicit
and ordered** — you're hand-curating a themed reading list.

Membership shows up on **both sides** automatically, with nothing extra to author:
- The hub's own page lists its member books (as it always has).
- Every member book's own page gets a **"Featured in"** section under "If you
  like...", linking back to each hub it belongs to (a book can be in more than
  one). In JSON-LD, this is the book's `isPartOf` array — the same property
  used for its series, just with a second (or third...) entry per hub it's a
  member of, each a `CollectionPage` named stub pointing at that hub's `@id`.
  There's no reverse field to fill in on the book itself; membership is looked
  up from the hub's `books` list at build time.

### Event — `src/content/events/<slug>.md`

Appearances, launches, signings. All events render on `/events`.

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `name` | ✅ | |
| `slug` | ✅ | |
| `description` | ✅ | |
| `startDate` | ✅ | ISO date/datetime. |
| `endDate` | | Optional. |
| `location` | | Free text (venue / city). |
| `url` | | Event page / ticket link. |
| `eventAttendanceMode` | | `online` \| `offline` \| `mixed` (default `offline`). |

> The `events/` folder ships empty (just a `.gitkeep`). Add a file to populate `/events`.

---

## Configuration

Three things you **must** set before deploying. The first is the classic
silent-failure trap — the build passes with placeholders, but your structured data
is wrong.

### 1. Your site URL (set it in TWO places)

Every canonical `@id` in the JSON-LD is built from your site URL. Left as
`https://example.com`, the build **succeeds** but emits `@id`s on the placeholder
domain — valid-looking, silently wrong. Set your real production URL in **both**:

- **`astro.config.mjs`** → `site: 'https://yourdomain.com'`
- **`src/config.ts`** → `siteConfig.siteUrl: 'https://yourdomain.com'`

Keep them identical.

### 2. Lead-capture provider — `src/config.ts`

```ts
leads: {
  provider: 'mailerlite',   // 'mailerlite' | 'emailoctopus'
  doubleOptIn: true,        // single vs. double opt-in
  groups: [],               // provider list/group IDs
}
```

This selects which adapter the newsletter form uses. The signup **endpoint** is
Tier 2 (see below); the choice is wired now so it's ready.

### 3. Secrets — `.env` (Tier 2)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the block for your chosen provider
(`MAILERLITE_API_KEY`, or `EMAILOCTOPUS_API_KEY` + `EMAILOCTOPUS_LIST_ID`). These
are only consumed once Tier 2's endpoint is live. **Never commit real values** —
set them as Cloudflare Pages secrets in production.

---

## Validating your structured data

The build catches *schema* errors (a missing required field). It does **not**
catch *structured-data* errors — a dangling reference, a canonical URL on the wrong
node, an author `@id` that resolves nowhere. Those pass `astro build` silently and
are exactly what breaks GEO.

The enforcement is a **SHACL validation gate** (see the companion `schema-validator`
setup). The workflow:

1. `npm run build`
2. For each built page in `dist/`, collect **all** `<script type="application/ld+json">`
   blocks on that page and merge them (a crawler reads them together — the page's
   `WebSite` node and its entity node live in separate blocks).
3. POST the merged per-page graph to the validator.
4. It must return **SUCCESS** with **zero dangling references** on every page type
   (home, about, book, series, theme, events).

The gate enforces the two rules that make this product work:
- **DD-001:** every `author`/`publisher` reference resolves to a `Person` (a named
  stub `{@type, @id, name}` is accepted — see the DDs).
- **DD-005:** the primary Book carries its own canonical `url`; retailer links are
  `Offer.url` on editions.

> If you change engine code that touches JSON-LD, **the gate is your proof**, not
> a green build. It is designed to fail loudly on the silent-failure classes above.

---

## Deploying to Cloudflare Pages

Tier 1 is a **static** site (`output: 'static'`), so it deploys to Cloudflare
Pages as plain built assets — no Worker runtime, no bindings.

**Before you deploy:** set your real site URL in both places (see
[Configuration](#configuration)).

### Option A — Git integration (recommended for clone-and-edit)

Cloudflare builds and deploys on every push.

1. Push this repo to GitHub/GitLab.
2. Cloudflare dashboard → **Workers & Pages → Create → Pages → Connect to Git** →
   pick the repo.
3. Build settings:
   - **Framework preset:** Astro
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Build output directory:** `dist`
   - **Node version:** set an env var `NODE_VERSION` = `22.12` (or newer) so the
     build host matches the project's requirement.
4. **Save and Deploy.** Cloudflare builds `dist/` and serves it. Every push to the
   production branch redeploys; other branches get preview URLs.
5. Add your custom domain under the project's **Custom domains** tab.

`wrangler.toml` already declares `pages_build_output_dir = "./dist"` for this flow.

### Option B — Direct upload with Wrangler (manual / CI)

```sh
npm install -g wrangler      # or npx wrangler
npm run build
wrangler pages deploy dist   # first run prompts to create/select the Pages project
```

Use this for local one-off deploys or a custom CI pipeline.

---

## Tier 2 — what's deferred

The newsletter **form** (`SubscribeForm`) ships in Tier 1 and posts to
`/api/subscribe`. That **endpoint** is intentionally deferred: it's a server route
(`prerender = false`, imports `cloudflare:workers`) and requires SSR, which Tier 1's
static build deliberately doesn't enable. Until Tier 2 lands, the form is inert.

To bring it online (Tier 2):
1. In `astro.config.mjs`, switch to `output: 'server'` + `adapter: cloudflare()`
   (the commented block is right there).
2. In `wrangler.toml`, uncomment the Workers/D1 block.
3. Add `src/pages/api/subscribe.ts` (the lead-capture adapters under
   `src/lib/leads/` are already present).
4. Set the provider secrets as Cloudflare Pages/Workers secrets.

At that point Tier 1 stops being a pure static deploy and becomes an SSR/hybrid
Cloudflare deploy — which is why it's a deliberate tier boundary, not a default.

---

## For developers / AI editors

The engine is small and layered. If you're modifying the code (or you're an AI
asked to), this is the map — and the contract you must not break.

```
src/
  content.config.ts     # THE CONTRACT: Zod schemas for every collection. Source of truth.
  config.ts             # author-editable behavior (site URL, leads provider)
  lib/
    ContentSource.ts     # the seam: the interface templates + JSON-LD depend on
    sources/FileSource.ts# reads content collections -> ContentSource (co-author aware)
    jsonld.ts            # THE ENGINE: builds the schema.org @graph (nodes + named stubs)
    leads/               # MailerLite / EmailOctopus adapters (Tier 2)
  layouts/Base.astro     # emits the sitewide WebSite node (+ publisher named stub)
  components/            # JsonLd, SubscribeForm, CompsBlock
  pages/                 # route templates: index, about, books/[slug], series/[slug],
                         #   themes/[slug], events/index
```

**The rules that make the structured data correct** (violating them is a silent
failure the build won't catch — run the gate):

1. **One canonical definition, referenced everywhere else (DD-001).** Each entity
   (a `Person`, a `Book`) is fully defined **once**, at its canonical `@id`. Every
   other reference to it is a **named stub** — `{@type, @id, name}` — never a bare
   `@id` (which dangles for consumers that don't chase `@id`), and never a second
   full definition (which creates two competing authorities). The canonical `Person`
   lives on `/about`; the homepage shows the author blurb as **display text only** and
   emits no second Person node.

2. **Authors are always an array** (co-author-safe), everywhere — schema, seam,
   and emission.

3. **Canonical URL discipline (DD-005).** A Book's `url` is its page on this site.
   Retailer buy-links are `Offer.url` on editions, never `Book.url`.

4. **`site` is load-bearing.** `jsonld.ts` builds every absolute `@id` from
   `import.meta.env.SITE`. A wrong/placeholder `site` produces wrong `@id`s that
   pass the build.

5. **Prove changes with the gate, not the build.** Merge all `ld+json` blocks per
   page and validate; require SUCCESS + zero dangling refs across every page type.

6. **A page gets exactly ONE node describing the page itself, never two.**
   `Base.astro`'s per-page node is `WebPage` by default — but if a page's real
   subject is a more specific kind of page (e.g. a themed hub is a
   `CollectionPage`, which **is-a** `WebPage` in schema.org's own hierarchy),
   that page overrides the per-page node's own `@type`/`@id`/extra properties
   (`pageType`/`pageId`/`pageExtra` props on `<Base>`) rather than ALSO
   emitting a second, separate full node (fixed 2026-07-23 — hub pages used to
   do exactly that, asserting the same `name`/`description` twice for one
   URL). See `hubPageExtra()` in `jsonld.ts` and `themes/[slug].astro`.

7. **Every image `alt`, `og:image:alt`/`twitter:image:alt`, and `Person.url`
   must describe the actual thing it's attached to** (fixed 2026-07-23) — never
   a generic fallback or the page `title`, which describes the page, not
   necessarily the picture next to it (the homepage's `title` is the author's
   name; its image is a book cover). Pass `imageAlt` alongside `image` to
   `<Base>`; it resolves in lockstep so the two can never drift apart.

**When you pull upstream:** engine changes land in `src/` (outside `src/content/`);
your content stays untouched. If an upstream schema change requires a content
migration, it'll be called out — re-run the gate after migrating.

---

## The design decisions that govern this repo

The authoritative design decisions (DD-001 … DD-005) are recorded in the project's
documentation. Two you'll meet immediately:

- **DD-001 — Identity model.** Canonical `Person` at `/about#<slug>`; reference by
  `@id` + **named stub** everywhere else; authors are arrays (co-author-safe).
- **DD-005 — Editions & offers.** Primary Book owns the single on-site canonical
  `url`; editions carry `bookFormat`/`isbn` and `offers`, with the retailer link as
  `Offer.url`.

Where a DD and any older doc/scaffold disagree, **the DD wins.**
