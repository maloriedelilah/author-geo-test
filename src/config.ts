  // --- Theme -----------------------------------------------------------
  // `mode` picks one of the two built-in palettes (see src/styles/theme.css).
  // `accent` is optional — override just the accent color without touching CSS.
  // This is an AUTHOR-TIME choice baked in at build (no visitor-facing toggle,
  // no JS/localStorage) — ask the author which they want, set it here.
  theme: {
    mode: 'dark' as 'dark' | 'light',
    accent: undefined as string | undefined, // e.g. '#ffb454' — omit to use the mode's default
  },

  // --- Header --------------------------------------------------------------
  // `logo.src` is a path under public/ (e.g. '/logo.svg') for authors who want
  // a wordmark image instead of plain text — omit it (leave undefined) to fall
  // back to the author's name as a text wordmark, which is the default and
  // needs no asset at all. `logo.alt` defaults to the author's name if unset.
  //
  // `layout` picks how the brand (logo/wordmark) and nav sit relative to each
  // other: 'left' is the classic header — brand on the left, nav on the right,
  // one row. 'centered' stacks them — brand centered on its own row, nav
  // centered underneath. Ask the author which they'd like, same as theme.mode.

  },

  // --- Header nav --------------------------------------------------------
  // Rendered in the header per `header.layout` above, after the brand
  // (logo/wordmark). /contact ships as a static form (Tier 1); it doesn't
  // actually deliver mail until the /api/contact endpoint is wired in Tier 2
  // — see README "Contact form". Remove this nav entry if you'd rather hide
  // the page until that's live.
